git allows for version control

What does git do at a high level?
	- Keep track of changes to your code
	- Sync code between different people
	- Test code without losing original copy
		- Test new features while preserving working features
	- Reverting back to old versions of your code

GitHub is just a website to store git repos on the internet and share with other people

git clone <url> -> takes a repo stored somewhere else and creates a copy on your computer

cd -> change directory

ls -> list all files in directoy

touch -> creates a brand new file

git add <filename> -> tells git to track that file the next time I save a copy of the repo

git commit -m "message" -> commit to GitHub and explain what is different with the code

git status -> tells you what is currently goin on in your repo 

git push -> push updates to the remote server

git pull -> download the latest remote server changes of your repository

Merge Conflicts
----------------
When changes made to the same lines of the same files. 

git log -> shows you a history of all of the commits that have been made

git reset --hard <commit> -> reset whole repo back to that commit hash
git reset --hard origin/master -> reset whole repo back to the origin 

git commit -am -> add and commit message at same time

git reflog 

HTML .....
-----------
<!DOCTYPE html>  -> Tells us that this is an HTML document

<head> -> info about the page (metadata)

<title> -> Assigns the title of the webpage

<body> -> the body of the website

in terminal use 'open index.html' to automatically open the page 

The indentation in HTML is just style. It is not necessary. 

<h1></h1>  -> This introduces headers. The number represents the size (1-6)

Control Click in Chrome and then View Page Source

<ul>  -> Unordered list

<li> -> list item

<ol> -> Ordered list

Inserting an image into a webpage
	<img src="cat.jpg">
Giving attributes to our image
	<img src="cat.jpg" height="200" width="300">

Could also leave off one of the arguments and have it render nicely

Could also specifiy pixels or as a percentage
	- As a percentage, the image moves as your shrink the webpage

Rendering tables in HTML

<table> -> initiate table
<tr> -> table row
<th> -> table headers
<td> -> table data

Creating an html form
<form> -> initiate a form
<input type="text" placeholder="Full name" name="name">
<button>Submit!</button> 

Document Object Model
	-Think of tree structures

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
----------------------------
Interacts with HTML to make it pretty
<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">Welcome to My Web Page!</h1>

These are two CSS properties within our HTML code. 

Can also use color HEX values instead of English color names 

Google "html color picker" -> Gives you HEX and RGB codes

HEX is RGB represented in base16 

--------------------------------------------------
# Applies to the whole page whereever h1 appears
<style>
h1 {
	color: blue;
	text-align: center;
}
</style>

<h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
<h1>This is my second same style header!</h1> 
--------------------------------------------------

<head>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

------------------
$ styles.css
------------------
h1 {
	color: blue;
	text-align: center;
}
-------------------



Common CSS Properties
---------------------
<div></div> -> a section of code that you wish to do something with

div {
	background-color: teal;
}


OR FONTS
div {
	font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
	font-size: 20px;
	font-weight: bold; 
}



<style>
	table {
		border: 3px solid black;
		border-collapse: collapse;
		width: 50% 
	}
	th, td {
		border: 1px solid black;
		text-align: center;
	}
	th {
		background-color: light grey;
	}
</style>


// Putting in a div just to name it as the top of the webpage

<body>
	<div id="top">
		This is the <span class="name">top</span> of the page.
	</div>
</body>

At somepoint, I can refer to all of the different span classees named "name" to edit the styling. 

#top -> # short for id. Get me all things that are id top 

.name _> . short for class. Get me all things that are class name
